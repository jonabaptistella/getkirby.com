This is a release candidate. Please verify that your old accounts can still login and everything else works as expected, so we can release this as soon as possible.

## Security

We have been contacted by an independent (link: https://www.tad.group/en/ text: security research company) on Monday (June 25th). They ran penetration tests across Kirby and found possible issues with our password hashing. With our ongoing support of PHP 5.4, our password hashing is not as strong as it could be.

Therefor we finally decided to make a cut and remove support for PHP 5.4 with this new release. The minimum version for Kirby 2 is now PHP 5.6. We will entirely remove support for PHP 5+ with (link: blog/questions-about-kirby-3 text: Kirby 3) and move to PHP 7+, but we know that many of you still run on PHP 5+ with v2.

We now use the new and recommended `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions. All old passwords will automatically be upgraded to the stronger hashes on the next login.
